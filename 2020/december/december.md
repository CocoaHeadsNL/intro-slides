Since iOS 13 you are able to read ID cards and passports.
Discover what is possible with the system iOS framework and what you need to add on top of it to scan and verify identity documents. Which data you can extract from documents and how you can verify the authenticity of these documents. And, of course, see a live demo of scanning a real ID as well.
